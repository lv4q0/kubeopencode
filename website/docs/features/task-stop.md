# Task Stop

Stop a running task using the stop annotation:

```bash
kubectl annotate task my-task kubeopencode.io/stop=true
```

When this annotation is detected:
- The controller deletes the Pod (with graceful termination period)
- Task status is set to `Completed` with a `Stopped` condition
- The `Stopped` condition has reason `UserStopped`

**Note:** Logs are lost when a Task is stopped. For log persistence, use an external log aggregation system.
